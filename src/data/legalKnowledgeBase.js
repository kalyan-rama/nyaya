    body: `**Article 14 — Right to Equality (Constitution of India)**

**What it guarantees:**
The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.

**Two core principles:**
• **Equality before law** — No one is above the law. Government officials, ministers, judges — everyone must follow the law equally
• **Equal protection of laws** — People in similar situations must be treated similarly

**Key rule — Reasonable Classification:**
The law CAN treat different groups differently, BUT only if:
1. The classification has an intelligible differentia (clear difference)
2. The difference has a rational connection to the object of the law

**Examples of violations:**
• Government gives benefit to Group A but denies identical Group B without reason
• A public official applies law harshly to one person, leniently to another
• Arbitrary cancellation of license/permit without justification

**Landmark cases:**
• E.P. Royappa v. Tamil Nadu (1974) — Arbitrariness is the enemy of equality
• Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) — Article 14 has wide reach

**Your Remedies:**
→ File **Writ Petition** in High Court under Article 226
→ File **Writ Petition** in Supreme Court under Article 32
→ Approach **National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)**
→ File complaint with **State Human Rights Commission**
